# Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Non-Negative Matrix-Co-Factorisation (NMCF)

Refer to "example_code.m" on usage of these functions. 

"nmf_clsuter1.m", "nmf_cluster2.m" and "nmf_cluster2_training" present existing NMF methods for heart and lung sound sepration. 

"nmcf_overall2.m" presents the proposed NMCF and NMF methods to separate noisy chest sounds into heart and lung sounds, and cry, stethoscope movement, respiratory support and unsupervised noise. 

"nmcf_overall.m" presents the proposed NMCF and NMF methods to seprate noisy chest sounds into heart and lung sounds and supervised and unsupervised noise.
