%
% Desciptions:
%   (1) [an,coef,t]=conv_AFD(s,max_level,M): decomposes signal s to max_level
%       levels. The magnitude searching dictionary of an generated based on M.
%       The phase searching dictionary of an gnerated according to the length of
%       the signal s.
%   (2) [an,coef,t]=conv_AFD(s,max_level,M,L): Same as (1) but the phase
%       searching dictionary of an generated according to L.
%
% Inputs:
%   s: 1*K pocessed discrete signal
%   max_level: maximum decomposition level
%   M: if it is a integer number, it is the maximum number of the magnitude
%      values of a_n in the searching dictionary, and the dictionary of the
%      magnitude values is unique distributed in [0,1).
%      if it is an array, it is the dictionary of the magnitude values.
%   L: if it is a integer number, it is the maximum number of the phase
%      values of a_n in the searching dictionary, and the dictionary of the
%      phase values is unique distributed in [0,2*pi).
% Outputs:
%   an: values of a_n for n=0,2,...,N
%   coef: values of coef_n for n=0,2,...,N
%   t: phase of s
